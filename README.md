# browser_media_player
This project, housed in a public repository, represents my attempt to utilize the Firefox browser as an MP3 media player. It aims to create a simple media player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that runs directly within the browser, enabling the user to load local audio files with metadata and present the user that metadata seamlessly.

## Features
- Play local audio files.
- Display metadata of the audio files:
    - file length, title, type, date, author, duration ...
- All shown with a user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
3. Use the interface to select and play local audio files.
4. Metadata of the audio files will be displayed within the browser.
